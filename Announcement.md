Hello

I'm pleased to announce the release of Trisquel-Gamer: a live DVD full with Free Software games, just boot and play!. The project homepage is http://code.google.com/p/trisquel-gamer/

The project goal is to provide a live DVD full of Free Software games, that is playable without the need to install anything. Also, Trisquel Gamer allows to save game data and settings automatically in a USB flash drive: Just connect an USB flash drive after booting the DVD and it will save your data in it. No additional configuration is required.

Trisquel Gamer is completely free software and the Live DVD will only contain free software games with free media licenses. There is a list of the games included at http://code.google.com/p/trisquel-gamer/wiki/GamesIncluded

All the games included in Trisquel Gamer have an article at http://libregamewiki.org/ and http://freegamer.blogspot.com/ . So if you are a fan of those sites you will probably recognize all the games included.

The live DVD iso is available as a Torrent download at http://trisquel-gamer.googlecode.com/files/trisquel-gamer-2010-2.iso.torrent (Please help me seed!) If you have some free time please check it out, and report any bugs you find to http://code.google.com/p/trisquel-gamer/issues/list

Please remember this is the first release of Trisquel Gamer and it will have bugs for sure, so please be patient.

I'll write some documentation this weekend, but if you are familiar using Linux distributions on a live DVD, I'm pretty sure there will be no problem figuring Trisquel Gamer out.

I hope you find it enjoyable.

Regards.
David Zaragoza
